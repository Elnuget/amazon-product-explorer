# Task Completion Checklist
- Run relevant Expo command (`npm start` or platform-specific) to verify bundle builds.
- Ensure added/updated code handles loading/error states and remains responsive.
- Update or add tests when introduced (none currently present but plan for future).
- Review TypeScript types and ensure strict typing.
- Confirm API keys and environment variables remain secure (use `.env`).
- Document significant changes or commands in README if necessary.
