# Style & Conventions
- Use TypeScript with strong typing across components, hooks, and services.
- Follow Clean Architecture: keep UI, hooks, services, and types separated; use custom hooks for business logic.
- Maintain minimal, clear code; add comments only when logic is non-obvious.
- Handle loading and error states explicitly in UI components.
- Keep design responsive and reusable via shared components.
- Avoid emojis in code and documentation unless already present.
- Use ASCII characters by default unless file already contains Unicode icons.
